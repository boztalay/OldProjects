WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   display/to_decoder_cmp_eq0000 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <RAM_wait_IBUF> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp DCM_1, consult the device
   Interactive Data Sheet.
