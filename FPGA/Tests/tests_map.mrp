  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.10

Peak Memory Usage:  203 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your license support version '2010.04' for WebPack expires
in -69 days.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   display/to_decoder_cmp_eq0000 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
   4 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------
Unused block "CQ/GND" (ZERO) removed.
Unused block "CQ/VCC" (ONE) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		CQ/BU2/XST_GND
VCC 		CQ/BU2/XST_VCC
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
