OldProjects
===========

These are most of my old projects (high school and earlier) from when I was first learning how to code. Some of them are finished, some of them aren't. Most of the code is iffy, but that's how it was.

Some of the more interesting projects include:

 - Pong, written in C++ using SDL
 - Various physics simulators, written in C++ using OpenGL
 - An assembler for the OZ-3
 - Lots of VHDL stuff that's likely reusable
